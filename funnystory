I was grabbing food with my dad and some of his friends the other day. They were discussing how this weekends Patriots game might get rained on and how the guy going would get soaked. He then explained how hes got good seats under a balcony so he actually would be ok. I decided to speak up and point out what I thought was a funny story how two seasons ago my dad and I went to a game that got rained on but our seats were under a balcony as well so we were dry. The guy that was talking earlier just smirked and said, "Yea; those are my seats." I had completely forgotten he had given my dad those tickets. Everybody laughed.
